### Entrepreneur, Software Engineer, & IT Professional

I'm a Software Engineer. I'm a lover of Bash, Python, Database Science, NodeJS, TypeScript, NestJS, React, NextJs, and building cool stuff.


## About Me

I am passionate about new, innovative technologies. I have years of experience in technology. I co-founded Serepok Coworking Space (a share working space solution for business) and played a major role (Data team) in the creation of Lazada (biggest ecommerce marketplace in Southest Asia) in my early 25's. I have been involved with multiple startups in both leadership and technology capacities.
