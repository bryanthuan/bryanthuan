## About Me

I am passionate about new, innovative technologies. Programming websites at the age of 19, and starting Connegg Technology (an IT consulting and repair business) at 20, I have years of experience in technology. I co-founded Serepok Coworking Space (a share working space solution for business) and played a major role in the creation of Lazada (biggest ecommerce marketplace in Southest Asia) in my early 25's. I have been involved with multiple startups in both leadership and technology capacities.
